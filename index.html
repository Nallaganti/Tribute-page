                    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam  was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 13th President of India from 2002 to 2007.
                         He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. 
                         He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research 
                         and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved 
                         in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.He thus came to be known as the 
                         'Missile Man of India' for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
                         He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, 
                         the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>

                    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in
                         the pilgrimagecentre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now 
                         in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of 
                         a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a 
                         ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
                         Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders 
                         and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, 
                         the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic 
                         found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and local women. Their business had involved trading groceries
                          between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had 
                          to sell newspapers in order to add to the family's meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses 
                          failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.
                          In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a 
                        strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.After completing his education at 
                        the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the 
                        University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.
                        While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project 
                        was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".
                        He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the</p>

                    <p>Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated
                         in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology 
                         of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet 
                         to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects. His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.
                         Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.
                         R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, 
                         an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.

                        
                        In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet</p>  </div>

                        It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July 2017.On display are the replicas of rockets and missiles which Kalam had worked with.
                         Acrylic paintings about his life are also displayed along with hundreds of portraits depicting the life of the mass leader. There is a statue of Kalam in the
                          entrance showing him playing the Veena. There are two other smaller statues of the leader in sitting and standing posture.</p>

                    <p>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. 
                        While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.
                         At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.
                         He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.
                         Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.
                          His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</p>
